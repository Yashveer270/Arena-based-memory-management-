# Arena-based-memory-management-
Arena-based memory management is a type of memory management in which each allocated object is assigned to a region. A region, also called an arena, is a collection of allocated objects that can be efficiently deallocated all at once. It is used for compaction and serialization of complex data structures and objects, or for managing memory in safety-critical and /or fault tolerant systems.  An arena is just a large, contiguous piece of memory that you allocate once and then use to manage memory manually by handing out parts of that memory. In this you get full control over how the memory allocation works. The single library call for the initial allocation is the only thing out of your control.  Arenas can be used to allocate memory blocks of a fixed size. It can also be used for a particular task and once that task is over, it can be freed and we donâ€™t need to worry about individual deallocations. The arena consists of the unused memory and the heap. The heap is where all user-allocated memory is located. The heap grows up from a lower memory address to a higher memory address.
